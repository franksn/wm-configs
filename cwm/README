cwm (calm window manager) configurations
=====

====.cwmrc_dkeg_20140213
 * A bit bloated
 * Shows many of the possible options  
 * Alt=Mod1; M=Mod1  
 * M+Enter for urxvt  
 * M+p for dmenu  
 * Other than that, config is straight forward  

====.cwmrc_pidsley_20140214	
 * Minimal cwm config, mod4 bindings
